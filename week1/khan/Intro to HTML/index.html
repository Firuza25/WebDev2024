    <h1>Your Best</h1>
    <p> If you always try your best <br>
        Then you'll never have to wonder About what you could have done <br>
        If you'd summoned all your thunder. <br>
        And if your best <br>
        Was not as good <br>
        As you hoped it would be, You still could say, <br>
        "I gave today <br>
        All that I had in me."</p>


    <h1>About rabbits!</h1>
    
    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and  <strong>they reproduce more than any human <em>ever</em> has.</strong></p>

    
    <h2>Songs</h2>
    
    <p>Little Bunny Foo Foo, <br>
    I don't want to see you <br>
    scooping up the field mice <br>
    and bopping them on the head!</p>

    <h3>Some text</h3>
        <p>
        Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <strong>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br> </strong>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <strong>You just don’t get it, yet.</strong>
        Because the most <em>beautiful</em>, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
        </p>
